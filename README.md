Instagram Challenge
===================

This project replicates Instagram.

## Getting started ##
- Clone this repo:
  `git clone git@github.com:JL-J/instagram-challenge.git`
- From the command line:
  ```
  cd instagram-challenge
  bundle install
  rails: db:migrate
  rails server
  ```
- Visit localhost:3000 in your browser

## Testing ##
Testing is done in rspec and capybara. To run the tests from the command line: `rspec`

## My approach ##
Having mostly written programs using vanilla ruby and only a few gems, in this program I wanted to challenge myself by using new and unfamiliar technologies wherever possible. I have often shied away from this in previous projects as I have lacked the confidence to implement something new. I have therefore maximised their usage, and chosen gems based on recommendations and research.

I have also created a Wiki to document my learning.

## Technologies used ##
- Ruby on Rails
- ActiveRecord
- _New: Active Storage_
- Rspec and Capybara
